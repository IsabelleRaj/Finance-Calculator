# finance-calculator
A Python program which allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

The investment calculator calculates the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment, and the user can specify either simple or compound interest.

The home load repayment calculator calculates the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.
